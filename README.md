## Overview
This is an implementation of a modified LLL algorithm in `SageMath` and `Python` and a random sampling algorithm in `SageMath`.

## Description
- ModifiedLLL is an modification of the LLL reduction program, which can take a linearly dependent vector as input. 

- RandomSampling is a program that uniformly randomly sample the lattice vectors until the norm is shorter than the standard value.
  

## Requirement
- SageMath version 9.5
- Python version 3.10.12

## Install
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kwdlab/2403-Kawamoto.Kazuki.git
```
